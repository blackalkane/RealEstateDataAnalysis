# RealEstateDataAnalysis

Summary

Every year, all property owners in BC have to pay property taxesâ€”the single greatest
operating expense. The property tax is determined based on property assessment and property
tax rate (mill rates). This project will construct a predictive model to estimate property taxes
for a given property for the upcoming year. We are interested in tax prediction only in Metro
Vancouver because property assessment in Vancouver is likely to be much higher than that in
other areas. It might be helpful to perform separate analyses on Metro Vancouver so as to
improve prediction accuracy.

Objectives

To predict the property tax for a given property in Metro Vancouver for the upcoming year.
